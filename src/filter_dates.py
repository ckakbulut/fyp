def read_reviews(city_file):
    '''
    Reads a csv file containing reviews of a city, stores the city in a dictionary, stores the years of the reviews in a dictionary under the value of the city name, and stores the months of the reviews under the value of the years.

    i.e.  {city_name : [{2017 : [01, 02, 03 ...]}, 
                        {2018 : [01, 02, 03 ...]}]
                        }

    Parameters: 
        city_file (str): string format of csv file name being processed, in this case the reviews.csv file of each city renamed to {city_name}_reviews.csv

    Return:
        years_dict (dictionary): dictionary containing the years of the city being processed as keys and months with the corresponding listing id as a list of tuple values, ex: { 2018 : [(01, 5487182381), (05, 523315325), ...]}
